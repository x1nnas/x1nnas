👋 Hi, I’m José Ferreira

🌿 Full-Stack Web Developer | Building Calm, Secure & Thoughtful Web Experiences

I’m a full-stack web developer focused on building clean, secure, and user-centered applications. I mainly work with React + TypeScript on the frontend and Node.js + Express on the backend, with a strong emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and real-world problem solving.

I care about why things are built the way they are — from API design and authentication flows to UX decisions and code structure. I enjoy shipping complete features, refining them, and learning through iteration.

🌱 What I’m Currently Doing

I’ve completed the first part of an intensive full-stack bootcamp, where I focused heavily on:

Secure authentication & authorization (JWT, protected routes)

REST API design and backend architecture

Writing clean, maintainable TypeScript

Backend testing with Jest & Supertest

Building mobile-first, accessible UIs

I’m now starting the second phase of the bootcamp, diving into Web3 concepts and technologies, while continuing to strengthen my core full-stack foundations.

💡 Projects
MindEase (v1 completed)

A mobile-first emotional wellness application built with a strong focus on clarity, privacy, and simplicity.

Tech stack:

React

Node.js & Express

MongoDB

JWT authentication

Backend testing

Progressive Web App (PWA)

MindEase will continue to evolve with new features, but version 1 is complete and functional, serving as my first full end-to-end product.

Practice Projects (Ongoing)

I’m currently focusing on smaller, focused applications to sharpen specific skills such as:

Authentication flows

API integrations

Database modeling

UI/UX patterns

State management and app structure

These projects help me experiment, fail fast, and improve quickly.

Personal Portfolio (Under Construction)

I’m building a dedicated portfolio website to showcase:

Finished projects

My development process

Technical decisions and learnings

Once complete, it will serve as the main hub for my work.

(Some repositories are private due to academic requirements, but more public work is coming soon.)
