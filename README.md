# 👋 Hello, I'm José Ferreira

🌟 Aspiring Web Developer | Curious Mind | Building One Line at a Time  

Hi, I’m José! I’m currently learning the ins and outs of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and I’m fascinated by the endless possibilities of web development. Every day is an opportunity to learn something new, and I’m working hard to turn my ideas into fully functional and visually appealing websites and applications.  

I’m also someone who enjoys figuring things out, even when it means going down a rabbit hole of documentation or debugging. For me, it’s all about the journey as much as the destination.

## 🌱 My Learning Journey  
I’m focused on improving my front-end skills by diving deeper into JavaScript and exploring how to build engaging user interfaces. I also believe in making the web accessible and enjoyable for everyone, which is why I’m paying close attention to **accessibility** and **best practices**.  

🔮 **Looking Ahead**:  
In the future, I want to explore **Web3 technologies**. I’m fascinated by the idea of building decentralized applications (dApps) and learning how blockchain technology can make the web more transparent and community-driven.
