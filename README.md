# 👋 Hello, I'm José Ferreira

🌟 Web Developer | Lifelong Learner | Crafting Code One Line at a Time

Hi, I’m José! I’m passionate about building dynamic, user-friendly web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for the front end, and Node.js with Express.js for back-end development. I’ve also worked with databases like NoSQL and PostgreSQL, enabling me to create full-stack solutions. Currently, I’m diving deeper into React to master interactive UIs before branching out to other technologies.

I thrive on turning ideas into reality, whether it’s designing a responsive interface, building a RESTful API, or debugging a complex issue. For me, coding is a blend of creativity and problem-solving.

## 🌱 My Learning Journey  
I’m sharpening my full-stack skills by focusing on React for front-end development, mastering component-based architecture and state management. On the back end, I’ve built APIs using Node.js and Express.js, integrating them with NoSQL and PostgreSQL databases for robust data management. My current priority is to deepen my React expertise before exploring new frameworks or technologies.

I’m dedicated to accessibility and best practices, ensuring the web is inclusive and user-friendly for everyone.

## 🔮 Looking Ahead:
Once I’ve mastered React, I plan to expand my full-stack capabilities and revisit my interest in Web3 technologies, such as decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain.
