# 👋 Hello, I'm José Ferreira

🌿 Full-Stack Web Developer | Problem Solver | Building Thoughtful Digital Experiences

Hi, I’m José! I’m a full-stack web developer with a strong focus on building clean, secure, and user-centered applications. I work primarily with **React** on the frontend and **Node.js + Express** on the backend, designing systems that are scalable, maintainable, and enjoyable to use.

I’m especially interested in products that solve real problems through thoughtful design and solid engineering. Whether I’m structuring an API, refining user experience, or improving application security, I care deeply about clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability.

## 🌱 My Learning Journey  

I’m currently completing an intensive coding bootcamp focused on **full-stack web development**. My work emphasizes:

- Building secure authentication systems  
- Designing clean API architectures  
- Writing maintainable TypeScript code  
- Testing backend logic with Jest and Supertest  
- Creating mobile-first, accessible user interfaces  

I learn best by building real projects end-to-end and understanding *why* things are done — not just how.

## 💡 Projects I’m Working On  

- **MindEase** — A mobile-first emotional wellness application focused on clarity, privacy, and simplicity.  
  Built with React, Node.js, MongoDB, JWT authentication, backend testing, and a Progressive Web App architecture.

- **Personal Portfolio** — A curated space to showcase my work, process, and technical growth.

- **Full-Stack Practice Projects** — Smaller apps exploring authentication, APIs, database design, and UI patterns.

*(Most repositories are currently private due to academic requirements.)*
